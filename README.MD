Instructions:

Download Images dataset from: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1hqdrC7zNTdZnzEizl7r1yTO6UcocZXj5?usp=sharing

Paste the Images folder inside app folder.

Run "streamlit run appname.py" from console to run streamlit interface for our video game recommendation engine.

We have used NLP techniques for data wrangling and sentimental analysis.

In app.py we have used soft cosine similarity of user reviews and descriptions of video games as a similarity measure.

In other folders, you can find different measures of similarity such as regular cosine similarity, bleau and rogue-n.

You can view notebooks to see the Recommendation System code, Data Scraping techniques and Calculation of Soft Cosine Similarity among the corpus of texts.
